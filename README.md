# Through the Fog
## Description 

Through the Fog is a mobile app built on React Native that tracks user's real-time movement, presented by an unveiling of 'fog' from a map interface. It was built to encourage exploration and through GeoTagging to allow memories in pictures to be associated by their location on the map.

You can view a group presentation about the project and a demo of the app [here](https://github.com/Mburnand-tech/Through-the-fog/assets/82216191/a9f72ebc-2b5d-42ab-bc9e-c9800d137ee3).

Features:
- Tracking, recording and displaying of a user's geographical data. Sensitive to height, the higher the phone the more fog is uncovered
- Create or Login User
- Scoreboard of area uncovered by all users
- Toggle fog colour.
- Delete user's fog history.

## Team
As a team of 6, I was part of a 3 person team who built the front-end, including the map functionality and geotagging. The other 3 built the back-end, which can be found [here](https://github.com/leahbanks/BE-through-the-fog), which I didn't contribute towards
